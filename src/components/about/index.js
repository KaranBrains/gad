              G.A.D first opened its doors in September 2010. Initially, a
              couple of classrooms at 7475 135th Street, Surrey were leased to
              teach a total of 16 students from Kindergarten to Grade 3. At that
              time, the vision and purpose of the school were established by a
              group of committed parents who wanted to raise their children with
              Sikh values while also maintaining a smooth transition to the
              mainstream multicultural community.There were many hurdles in the
              early stages. Facilities, staffing, equipment and parent support
              were all integral to G.A.D. becoming firmly rooted. Although
              meagre in the early years, those families stood by us through the
              tough challenges of establishing this school. They had strong
              convictions and believed in the growth and development of the
              school. In 2011 – 2012, the school leased more units in the same
              building. The school grew and developed during that period. A
              pre-school was added to the facility. The following year 2012 –
              2013 more units were leased and the enrollment reached a peak of
              200 students from Kindergarten to Grade 6. The overwhelming
              response of the parents and the growing popularity of the school
              enthused the Board of PALS Society to look for a bigger campus.
              Fortunately, they found the present location, 13479 77th Avenue,
              Surrey to be an ideal place for the school. They envisioned
              remodelling with spacious classrooms, a huge gym, open playfield,
              a large parking area, and the possibility of expansion in the
              future. In September 2013, PALS Society of Canada after seeking
              Waheguru Ji’s blessing opened the doors of its new facility where
              they could grow the school to support the expanding student body.
              The school is committed to providing new educational programs and
              learning experiences for the students to help them become
              responsible and contributing members of society.
